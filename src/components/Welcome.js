            As the premier anti-crime advocacy and lobby group in Kenya, our aim is to mobilize communities to build ownership around safety,
             justice and socio-economic issues. We therefore primarily focus on discouraging at risk and vulnerable youth from engaging in 
             criminal activities and address threats to peace through behavioral and attitudinal change while promoting the benefits of a
              crime-free society.

Our organisation is anchored on three key pillars : education, advocacy and social enterprise with access to justice 
encompassing all pillars.
