                <span>
                Started as an anti-crime advocacy and lobby group in 2007 in the Death Row Section of the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison, and formally registered as a non-governmental organization in 2010, the Youth Safety 
                Awareness Initiative popularly known by its Swahili brand name, Crime Si PoaÂ® (meaning crime is not cool) is anchored on three key pillars, namely: education, advocacy and social enterprise. 

Our aim is to mobilize communities to build ownership around safety,
 justice and socio-economic issues. We therefore primarily focus on discouraging 
 at risk and vulnerable youth from engaging in criminal activities and address threats 
 to peace through behavioral and attitudinal change while promoting the benefits of a crime-free society.
